grpc Examples
==============================================

Assuming you are in the grpc-java root folder you would first start the route guide server
by running

```
$ ./gradlew :grpc-examples:pollServer
```

and in a different terminal window then run the route guide client by typing

```
$ ./gradlew :grpc-examples:pollClient
```

That's it!
